              <p>As teens get older, they seek opportunities to develop new skills and prepare for the future. 
                Each summer, The GreenHouse offers career exposure internships for 10th-12th grade youth. 
                High schoolers complete a forty hour internship over five weeks, learning under the supervision 
                of an internship leader, developing job skills and discovering related career fields while 
                obtaining experience for their resumes. Internships incorporate rising levels of skill-building 
                that culminate in a final project and time for reflection to integrate deeper learning. Teens 
                that complete the internship receive a $350 stipend. Internship focus areas for 2022 include 
                Web Design, Culinary Arts, Photography & Digital Communications, and Recreation Leadership.

              <p>In the Web Development internship, students learn the fundamental building blocks of the 
                internet: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Principles of web design and project management are also 
                emphasized. After learning the foundations of these coding concepts, these skills are put into 
                practice and a web page is designed and built for a community client. Throughout the process, students 
                will follow a real-world professional project plan.</p>

              <p>In this internship, teens will learn about photography hardware, composition, lifestyle 
                photography, portrait photography, social media management, and photo editing. Interns take 
                pictures and video of community events and day-to-day activities at The GreenHouse, and then 
                complete hands-on publicity projects like social media posts, video, and an e-newsletter.

              <p>The GreenHouse relies significantly on photography and digital communications: updating current

                through monthly digital newsletters. We contract two interns during the school year who show 
                responsibility and demonstrate interest in taking pictures, posting on our social media, and 
                working alongside GreenHouse communications staff on special projects. These interns develop 
                extensive skill sets relevant for a variety of future career opportunities as well as significant 
                resume and reference material.

                Interns learn the art of the kitchen, and discover what a career in food service might look 
                like. They practice food safety, reading and improvising on recipes, how to use various kitchen 
                tools, and food preparation skills. Throughout the five week session, teens gain confidence in 
                the kitchen and improve knowledge of making a balanced meal. The culminating project involves 
                cooking a four-course meal for groups of guests, developing meal planning and preparation skills 
                as well as table setting, creation of environment, and food service skills. These skills sets 
                prepare interns to work in a diversity of food-related industries and carry food safety, 
                preparation, and nutrition skills into their lives long-term.

                Each day, we will make a meal that is balanced - including a protein, starch, and vegetable. The
                food that we make will be used by other GreenHouse programs, like Oasis or the elementary summer
                programs. And at the end of the internship, students will be able to test for a professional
                food safety handler certificate.

              <p>The Recreation Leadership internship is a fun and exciting way to build leadership and social 
                skills that are relevant for teens' lives and professional journeys long-term. High school teen 
                interns work as leaders in The GreenHouse's middle school summer camp, serving as mentors and 
                creating a welcoming, fun, safe environment. Interns develop social skills as they initiate with 
                new teens, encourage participation, and learn to read the temperature of a group.</p>

            <div id="leader-text-2">
              <p>In addition, Recreation Leadership interns design and lead group activities on a weekly basis. 
                Each week, interns brainstorm games and activities that they think would engage the younger teens. 
                They think through materials and preparation prior to each activity, writing out the rules in 
                advance and troubleshooting potential challenges. On game day, interns prep and then lead the 
                games, adapting as needed and debriefing afterward to sharpen their group leadership skills. 
                Interns cultivate public speaking skills, getting more comfortable talking in front of groups 
                as they use their leadership skills to host and direct events.</p>
